Page: 2 of 6. COMMENT. This case was initially signed out as a provisional report on. and has been amended to include results of immunohistochemical. stains. The diagnoses have not changed from the original report. The lymph nodes resected in the case (specimen 1-8) show diffuse. involvement with well-formed non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Occasional mixed dust nodules with central hyalinization and focal. central necrosis are also present. Special stains for fungal elements. and acid-fast organisms are negative. There is no evidence of metastatic. carcinoma in any of the lymph nodes examined. :ctions of the tumor in specimen 8 show predominately moderately. differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (90%) with a small component. (10%) of a poorly differentiated spindle cell carcinoma that demonstrates. shows multiple mitoses and severe cytologic atypia. There is no. malignant cartilage, bone, or skeletal muscle identified in the spindle. cell component. Immunohistochemistry shows the squamous cell component. of the tumor to be positive for multiple cytokeratins (HMWK, CK5/6,. E1/AE3) and p63. The spindled component shows weak positive staining. for CK5/6 and p63, with very focal positive staining for CK7. The EGFR. shows strong membranous staining in approximately 90% of both the. moderately differentiated. component and the spindled component. Both. components are negative for p53 and TTF-1. The findings are consistent. with a pleomorphic carcinoma composed of predominantly squamous cell. carcinoma (moderately differentiated, 90%) and pleomorphic spindle-cell. carcinoma (poorly differentiated, 10%), pT2NO. The residual lung parenchyma in both specimen 1 (""wedge resection right. middle lobe"") and specimen 8 (""right lower lobe"") shows patchy. interstitial fibrosis that appears accentuated in a subpleural. distribution, with focal areas of architectural remodeling and cyst. formation (microscopic honeycomb change) There is mild chronic. interstitial inflammation associated with areas of fibrosis. Fibroblastic. foci are readily identified. The blood vessels show focal fibrointimal. thickening, likely secondary to the background inflammatory process, but. no diagnostic evidence of active vasculitis. Granulomas are noted within. an intraparenchymal lymph node (specimen 1), but are not identified in. the lung parenchyma itself. .ne overall findings in the lung tissue are in keeping with pulmonary. Page: 3 of 6. fibrosis of UIP pattern. However, the simultaneous presence of numerous. non-necrotizing granulomas within the lymph nodes is not typical of UIP,. and may indicate a second superimposed process, the differential. diagnosis of which is broad but which could include infections, drug. reactions, and sarcoidosis. Correlation with clinical and microbiologic. findings is recommended. ROSS DESCRIPTION.

Current. / practice guidelines recommend determination of EGFR and KRAS mutation status in adenocarcinoma of lung to help select patients for. Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) therapy. EGFR-activating mutations have been show to be significantly associated with response to TKIs and KRAS. mutations are associated with TKI resistance. They are mutually exclusive in. Additionally, recent data show that ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma. Kinase) gene rearrangements in adenocarcinoma of lung are associated with resistance to TKis and have favorableresponse rates to Crizotinib, the ALK. inhibitor. agent. currentiv. in clinical trials. Mutation analysis for KRAS and EGFR-TK domain and ALK gene rearrangement by FISH is available as the. Testing may be performed on paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary or metastatic tumor or pleural fluid cell block. - nese tests are available on request as a panel or as individual assays.

The specimens are inked with contrasting colors and each specimen is. bisected. The tissue is entirely submitted in cassette A1. B. The specimen is labeled right lower lobe and is received without fixative. It consists of a lobe of lung. which measures 16.0 X 9.5 X 3.8 cm and weighs 269.0 grams. The pleural surface of the superior portion. of the lobe has a mottled red to dark violet appearance and appears smooth. There is a prominent area. of puckering and distortion of the lateral basilar portion of the lung. Adjacent to this pleural puckering and. distortion are three subpleural firm prominent nodules which vary from 0.7 to 1.2 cm. There is another. subpleural nodule in the lateral apical portion of the lung. At the hilum of the lung a staple line is. dissected from the specimen and the bronchial margin is removed as a thin shave. There are three small. up to 0.6 cm peribronchial lymph nodes. The bronchi are opened and there is no gross evidence of. intraluminal tumor. Sections of the lateral basilar portion of the lung reveal a dull yellow relatively well. circumscribed neoplasm which measures 6.2 X 5.0 X 2.9 cm.

Left lower lobe: inflated, fixed left lower lobe of lung measuring 20 x 15 cm at the base and up to 17 cm in length,. central bronchus resection plane located 0.3 cm proximal to the bifurcation of B6. A 7 cm long branched staple suture. line runs in a ventrocaudal direction from the hilus. In the medioventral region over S6 a cusp-shaped part of the upper. lobe measuring 4 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm is attached, closed by a staple suture line. In the laterodorsal region over S6 and. adjacent sections of S10, part of the parietal pleura, measuring 9.5 x 5.5 cm, is mostly adhesive over an extensive area. and loosely attached in parts at the margin. At the hilus are 3 mobile grayish-black nodes between 0.2 and 0.7 cm in size. Ostium of B6 completely obstructed by endobronchial parts of a central, moderately solid, pale brownish, focally soft. tumor, max. 6 cm in size, located in S6, with unclear demarcation and extending right up to the ventral visceral pleura. over S6 and to within 0.2 cm of the hilar resection surface.

Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Central to peripheral, histologically poorly differentiate, large-cell, nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of. the lower lobe of the left lung located in S6. TNM classification according to this picture pT2 pN2 pMX R0, stage IIIA. C 34.3, M 8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Advanced, active, small foci of colliquating, chronic organizing and focal retention pneumonia accompanied by. fibrous remodeling of the parenchyma peripheral to the tumor associated with a pleural adhesion zone (sample. 1.)). Hilar lymph nodes of the main preparation and lymph nodes of samples 6.) and 7.) with uncharacteristic. reactive lesions, anthracotic pigment deposits and an old, nodular, cicatricially encapsulated area of necrosis. (sample 6.)). Remark/addendum: The tumor has obstructed B6 at its bifurcation, continuously infiltrated parabronchial lymph nodes and extended. focally to within at least 0.2 mm of the hilar resection surface. It has also grown across the pleural fissure. initially and into the co-resected tissue from the upper lobe and has formed further lymph node metastases in. samples 3.) - 5.). The resection lines of the bronchus and vessels, the resection plane of the wedge resection. specimen from the upper lobe and the lymph nodes located at the hilus of the main preparation (sample 1)), the. repeat resection specimen of sample 2.) and the lymph nodes of samples 6.) and 7.) are tumor-free. No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. However, very much further-reaching investigations, in. particular dust analytical studies, are needed to settle the question of asbestos dust exposure."

The specimen has been previously. sectioned to expose a 9.5 x 4.5 x 3.8 cm, white-tan, centrally located mass that bridges both the upper and lower. lobes. The pleural surface over this mass at the hilum is stretched and puckered without gross extension of the tumor. onto the pleural surface. However, in the left upper lobe, the tumor appears to extend beyond the pleura as a solid. mass. Also in this vicinity, and on the medial aspect of the lung, there is an 11 cm portion of fibrous tissue comprising. the reflection of the pleura at the mediastinum. The entire pleural surface overlying the tumar is inked blue. The pleura. in the uninvolved portions of the lung is grey-tan, wrinkled with scant fibrous adhesions linking the two lobes. At the. hilum, a few black-tan peribronchial fymph nodes are identified. The vascular margins are closed off with surgical. staples.

The final stage should be performed in. conjunction with the clinical information. Sections of the tumor show a poorly differentiated large cell. carcinoma. A panel of immunohistochemical stains is performed. including CK5/6, p63, TTF1 and CK7 (with appropriate positive and. negative controls). The neoplastic cells are positive for TTF1 and. CK7. The neoplastic cells are negative for CK5/6 and p63. The. overall histologic appearance in conjunction with the. immunohistochemical stains is consistent with a poorly. differentiated adenocarcinoma. In addition, some dense eosinophilic. collagenous scar tissue is present suggesting this may have. represented a so-called scar carcinoma. The carcinoma extends up to. but not into the visceral pleura, being separated from the pleural. margin by less than 1 mm. Clinical correlation and follow up is. recommended.

In the hilar region there is an 0.8 cm long. and 1.5 cm in diameter bronchial stump which is grossly. unremarkable. The vessels at the margin are also grossly. unremarkable. There are some tan-gray lymph nodes up to 1.2 cm in. greatest dimension in the hilar region. The pleural surface is. pink-purple with some anthracotic pigment deposition. There is some. retraction of the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned, and. there is a 2.6 x 2 x 1.8 Cm rubbery tan-white mass underlying the. area with pleural retraction, with the mass suggestive of invading. the pleura. Approximately 2 cm from this mass is a separate 4 x 3.5. x 3. Cm rubbery tan-white mass. This mass approaches at least near. to the pleural surface. The larger lesion has yellow-orange. discoloration surrounding it, suggestive of surrounding pneumonia. The remainder of the parenchyma is spongy and red-purple without. additional lesions.

The following template summarizes the findings in this. case: Histologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly. differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is. favored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent. foci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). Although not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) These two lesions are grossly 2.6 cm and 4 cm. in greatest dimension. The 2.6 cm in diameter lesion has visceral. pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very. peripherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. Although it is difficult to definitely distinguish between. synchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same. process, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new. guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION. would be classified as pT3. Clinical correlation is recommended. Margins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins. are negative. Direct extension of tumor: Visceral pleural extension for the 2. 6. cm in diameter lesion, no direct extension identified for the larger. lesion. Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified. Regional lymph nodes (pN) : pNl. There is metastatic carcínoma in. one of three hilar lymph nodes in part A. The separately submitted. lymph nodes in parts B, C, D, and E are negative for malignancy. Distant metastasis (pM) : pMX. Other findings: There are inflammatory changes surrounding the. tumors, with focally prominent pneumonia surrounding the larger. lesion. Note: This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental Consultation. with all reviewers interpreting the two mass lesions as similar in. appearance. 3,4x3,5. DIAGNOSIS. A.

COMMENTS: The endobronchial tumor in the right lower lobe (block B2) is stained with a battery of immunohistochemical stains to better categorize the nature of the. tumor. The tumor cells are strongly reactive with high molecular weight cytokeratin (SK) and greater than 70% of the tumor cell nuclei are positive with. p63. CD56. marks about 5-10% of the tumor cell cytoplasm and cytokeratin 5/6 marks approximately 20-30% of the tumor cells. Cytokeratin 7 and thyroid. transcription. factor-1 (TTF-1) are negative. These stains support a diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma. The mildly positive CD56. indicates a small component of a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The positive control slides for CK7. TTF-1, CD56, p63, and SK are appropriate. The. positive control for CK5/6 is assigned to case. CLINICAL INFORMATION. CLINICAL HISTORY: Preoperative Diagnosis: Right lower lobe lung cancer.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: Elastic. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK were sent on. for patient. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1B appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the. subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be. issued when the results of this molecular test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12V (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12. of the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor. prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. The laboratory is regulated under. the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of. as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This. particular test is not considered a stand along test and should be. used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical. work-up related to treatment decisions. Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 4% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor. receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential. responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a. sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: DISCLAIMER: This test was developed and its performance characteristics. determined by. It has not been cleared or approved by the. US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such. clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for. clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigation or. for research.

Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Peripheral, bronchopulmonary, histologically poorly differentiated, large-cell nonkeratinizing squamous cell. carcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung evidently located in S9. TNM classification according to this. picture pT1 pN3 pMX L1 R0, stage III. C 34.3;M 8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Numerous non-necrotizing epithelioid cell granulomata, largely in paravasal interstitial sites. Slight centroacinar. pulmonary emphysema (samples 1.) and 2.)). Hypocellular fibrosis area of parietal pleura (sample 3.)). Lymph. nodes with large foci of epithelioid cell reaction, nodular, central partly necrotically altered areas of sclerosis. and anthracotic pigment deposits (samples 4.) - 7.) and 9.)). Seborrheic keratosis of the skin of the akanthotic. type (sample 11.)). Remark/addendum: The carcinoma shows lymphangioinvasion at the tumor margin and has produced metastases in the hilar lymph. nodes of sample 2.) and in samples 8.) and 10.). The visceral pleura, the residual lower lobe of the lung,. including its resection margin of bronchus and vessels, and also the lymph nodes of samples 4.) and 7.) - 9.) are. tumor-free. The distribution pattern of epithelioid cell granulomata is primarily consistent with sarcoidosis. No asbestos bodies are found in the prepared section planes. But very much further-reaching investigations,. especially dust analyses, are needed to determine the asbestos exposure of the lung."

Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS: KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on. The test is to be performed on tissue from case. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited. accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose. signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,. examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1A appropriate to. the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9. unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to. where the subject molecular test will be performed. An. addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular. test are available. Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM #2: MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung. Specimen Type: Slides. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Wild-type gene. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. COMMENT: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor. prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS. mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly. associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated. for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in. fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In. particular the test performance has been established in samples of. colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor. these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to. harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,. appendix, etc.). Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide. additional information regarding this patient's probability of. response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if. clinically indicated. See references. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #2 performed by. ADDENDUM #3: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided. for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma. patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal. for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with. differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among. patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%. This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell. lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons. Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be. detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change. during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this. result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation. in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor. This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by. bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: 1. Azzoli CG, et al.

These are counted as lymph. nodes totally replaced by tumor. Therefore, this is staged as a. pN2b. In addition, lymphovascular space invasion is identified and. the additional classifications of VL are therefore used. The final. stage should be performed in conjunction with knowledge of the. clinical stage.

Gross Description: Received in a single container labeled. - right colon. and terminal ileum"" is a 23 cm previously opened portion of large. bowel including cecum, as well as 8 cm of attached previously opened. terminal ileum. The specimen is covered by a moderate amount of. pericolic and epiploic adipose tissue in which a 8.4 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. grossly unremarkable vermiform appendix is identified. The visible. serosa is focally shaggy and tan pink with a few fibrofatty. adhesions. Noted at a point approximately 9 cm from the distal. margin is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm area of indurated umbilication of the. serosa. The specimen has been received after tissue harvest for. genomic study. Within the specimen container are three tissue. cassettes each labeled. The bowel wall is up to. 0.6 cm edematous and fibrotic. The lumen is lined by tan pink mucosa. with preservation of intestinal folds. In the area corresponding to. the umbilication at a point 8.6 cm from the distal margin and 3.8 cm. from the ileocecal valve is a partially sectioned 9.2 x 7.5 cm. plaque like finely granular centrally ulcerated tan pink lesion with. raised rolled borders. This has a gritty gray tan fibrotic cut. surface measuring up to 3.2 cm in thickness. The lesion grossly. extends through the muscularis but is limited by the serosa in the. area away from the pericolic fat.

It has a central area of ulceration and. raised irregular erythematous edges. The appendix is dilated and measures 4.0. X 1.0 cm. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections through the tumor demonstrate a variable pattern. In areas, it. consists of atypical glandular structures formed by cells with irregular and. hyperchromatic nuclei. Additionally, areas consist of poorly differentiated. tumor. Here, the cells form solids nests and cords of spindle and polygonal. shaped cells without gland formation. The tumor invades the muscularis from. an ulcerated mucosal surface and extends into serosal tissues where it is. surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction. Sections through sixteen lymph nodes. disclose lymphoid hyperplasia and reactive changes, but no metastatic tumor. The resection margins are free of tumor as well.

Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used B7. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.15. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. natients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered.

Received is a breast biopsy specimen and frozen. section remnant. The breast tissue measures 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm. The surgeon. states that the margin is not important, thus the specimen is not inked. Sectioning of the specimen reveals a red-brown nodule measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x. 1.5 cm. Tissue from the nodule has been sent for ER/PR study. A remnant of. frozen section of the red-brown tissue measuring 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.3 cm is. submitted in toto in Block A1, with representative sections of the nodule. submitted in Blocks A2-A4. B. ""Left breast"", fresh. An 18 x 25 x 6 cm breast mastectomy specimen with a. 23 x 14 cm skin ellipse and a 12 x 9.5 cm axillary tail. The skin ellipse is notable for a grossly unremarkable nipple and areola and a. 5.5 cm recently dehised biopsy scar located in the lower medial portion of the. ellipse. The deep surface of the breast specimen is inked in black. Cut sectioning. through the breast reveals a 5 x 4 x 4 cm hollow biopsy cavity in the lower. medial quadrant which is lined by smooth white tissue in its cavity. The. cavity comes to within 0.5 cm of the inked distal surface, 0.8 cm from the. inked posterior surface, and 12 cm from the inked proximal surface. There is. a focal 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm firm, finely granular, grey-pink lesion located. adjacent to the lateral tip of the biopsy cavity. This lesion is, at its. closest points, 1.5 cm from the distal inked surface, 4 cm from the posterior. inked surface, 4 cm from the posterior inked surface, 11 cm from the proximal. inked surface, and 2 cm beneath the anterior skin surface.

""Right breast mass #1"", received fresh labeled with the patient's name and. record number for frozen section is a 4 x 2.9 x 2.2 cm specimen with a 2 x 2 x. 1.3 cm tumor. The frozen section remnant is submitted in A1. A2-A4 represent. full cross sections of the tumor and adjacent tissue. B. ""Right breast, long lateral short superior"", received fresh is a right. mastectomy specimen weighing 2040 grams. The skin ellipse measures 34.5 x. 17.5 cm, has a 4 cm areola and a 0.9 cm nipple. A suture marks the lateral. aspect of the specimen. The breast measures 35 x 23 x 6 cm with an 8 x 6.5 x. 1 cm axillary tail. In the upper outer quadrant is a recent sutured surgical. incision 7 cm. The soft tissue margins are inked blue. Sectioning shows a. recent biopsy cavity approximately 5 cm in diameter deep to the suture. On. the medial aspect of this biopsy cavity, another tumor is identified. While. contiguous with the cavity, the bulk of the tumor is more medial. This is felt. to represent a single ""dumbell"" shaped tumor rather than two separate tumors. Maximal dimensions of this tumor are 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm. This tumor is also. located in the upper lateral quadrant and is 2 cm from the deep resection. margin. Further firm tissue suspicious for tumor is identified in the lateral. aspect of the biopsy cavity and measures 2 cm. Again this is 2 cm from the. deep resection margin. Measuring from the medially located tumor to the. lesion present at the lateral aspect of the biopsy cavity the maximum tumor. diameter is 7 cm. The axilla is sampled from medial to lateral.

Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2,. HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit),. ). Control Slides Examined: External kit-slides. provided by manufacturer (cell lines with mign, low and regative HER2 protein expression), and in-house known. HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this. patient's sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive. carcinoma identified for HER2 evaluation. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System: IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern. Negative (0)/Absence of Staining. Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not. indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical. Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall. survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was. determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase. disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2. protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3). HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest. (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and. adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical. staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the. reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and. guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and. guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC. as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without. knowledge of the previous reported results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the. HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC. and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were. interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be. amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance. and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The. laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing. program. REFERENCE. 1.

Gross Description: Specimen is designated as prostate. Initially received in the fresh state for tumor bank study is a 42 gram. radical prostatectomy, 5.1 cm apex to base, 3.4 cm across and 3.2 cm posterior-anterior. The attached. right seminal vesicle extends up to 2.7 X 1.4 X 0.5 cm, adjacent vas 1.4 X 0.4 cm: the left seminal vesicle. extends up to 3.0 X 1.4 x 0.5 cm and corresponding vas 1.9 X 0.4 cm. The prostate margin has a shaggy,. pink and tan appearance and the margins are now differentially inked as follows: posterior - black, right. body prostate - blue and remaining left body prostate green. Sectioning through the bilateral seminal. vesicles demonstrate rubbery honeycomb, pink and tan cut surface without gross tumor involvement. The. prostate is serially sectioned, apex to base, demonstrating a variegated rubbery, mildly congested, pink. and yellow-tan cut surface with circumscribed nodularity predominating the anterior half of the specimen. against the urethral tract. A suspicious focus of glistening deep yellow change is appreciated near the left. apical and posterior margins upwards of 1.0 X 0.9 X 0.8 cm. Representative portion of this suspicious. lesion is submitted for tumor bank. Further examination of the cut sections of prostate demonstrate. additional foci of suspicious yellow-orange change posterior to the urethral tract near the base, upwards of. 0.5 cm, and the origin of the right seminal vesicles demonstrates an additional 0.5 cm focus of suspicion. for malignancy. Tissue included within the container are two oriented tubular fragments of apparent vas. deferens, 2.3 X 0.5 cm and 2.5 X 0.4 cm each. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic. evaluation.

This tumor focus measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the single cross. section. of. the. prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The tumor exhibits extensive extraprostatic extension in the right. posterolateral surface of the prostate and right superior neurovascular bundle region. The added length of extraprostatic extension. is 18.5 mm. On the right base, focal extension of tumor to the cauterized margin cannot be unequivocally excluded. The second. tumor focus is located in the left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 0.8 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension. and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate, focally in the apex and extensively in the base. This tumor focus is of. lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins. GROSS DESCRIPTION.

The prostate gland contains two separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and. one. in. the. peripheral. zone. The largest tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 5/3+2) located in the right and. left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.7 x 1.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present. in. four. cross. sections and focally in the apical region. This tumor focus is confined to the prostate and the margins of resection are free. of. tumor. The second tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid posterior and right posterior. peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.2 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross. sections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor focus is a high grade carcinoma (Gleason score 4+5). and. is. associated with an increased lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor focus exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left apex and left. posterolateral aspect of the prostate. Extraprostatic extension is present in two separate sections and the added length of. extraprostatic tumor is 9.0 mm. At the site of extraprostatic extension the margins of resection are free of tumor. This tumor focus. focally extends to less than 0.1 mm from the margin of resection in the apex. This tumor focus invades the intraprostatic portion of. the left seminal vesicle. Due to the presence of distortion in areas of the tumor close to the margins of resection in the apex and the presence of a marked. lymphocytic infiltrate, immunoperoxidase studies for keratin, lymphocyte marker and neuroendocrine differentiation markers were. performed. Cytokeratin highlights tumor which is seen focally approaching but not at the margins of resection. The lymphocytic. infiltrate is a mixture of both CD20 positive B lymphocytes and CD5 positive T lymphocytes with a predominance of the latter. The. tumor is negative for synaptophysin but a few scattered neoplastic cells are positive for chromogranir supporting the presence of. focal minimal neuroendocrine differentiation. Page: 4. (D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and. attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia. The prostate gland (4.5 x 2.5 x 4.5 cm, 40 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the. right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A nodule is palpated on the left posterolateral aspect of. the prostate include the left apex and left mid region. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate firm area consistent with. tumor in the left peripheral zone extending from the first to the third cross sections of the prostate. The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

COMMENT: The left posterior apical margin specimen submitted for frozen section (part B) contains a focus of. glandular epithelium with complex architecture, but without an infiltrative appearance. Immunohistochemical stains for p63 and HMWK were obtained on this specimen and the focus in. question is negative for basal cells. These results support our interpretation that this focus represents. prostatic adenocarcinoma. In addition, cauterized glands highly suspicious for adenocarcinoma are present at the inked, cauterized. apical margin of the main specimen (slides J1 and J2). Immunohistochemical stains for p63 and HMWK. were obtained on block J2 in order to evaluate these glands. The glands in question are negative for. basal cells, supporting the interpretation of these foci as adenocarcinoma and our interpretation that. this represents tumor at the inked, cauterized margin. Of note, the separately submitted anterior apical. margin (part G) and posterior apical margin (part H) are negative for carcinoma. Correlation with. operative findings is required in order to determine the final margin status.

ADDENDUM: The positive margin in this case (slide A6) was reviewed with Dr. and correlated with the gross. examination and operative report. During the operative procedure there was a surgical violation of the. prostatic capsule in two places that were marked by surgical sutures for gross examination. One of. these areas was at the site of the positive margin and comparing this information to the histological. section it is likely that inked drained through this surgically created cleft. In summary, it is likely that the. tumor present at the inked surface in this slide is not a true positive margin."

High-grade serous carcinoma, oxyphilic variant, 16.5 cm; see. comment. 2. Benign follicle cysts. - Left fallopian tube: No significant pathologic abnormality, no tumor. identified. B. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: No tumor identified in six lymph nodes. (0/6). C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: No tumor identified in eleven lymph. nodes (0/11). D. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision: No tumor identified in seventeen. lymph nodes (0/17). E. Lymph nodes, right peri-aortic, excision: No tumor identified in three. lymph nodes (0/3). F. Omentum, omentectomy: Reactive mesothelial hyperplasia, no tumor. identified. G. Appendix, appendectomy: No significant pathologic abnormality, no tumor. identified. H. Lymph nodes, left peri-aortic, excision: No tumor identified in nineteen. lymph nodes (0/19). COMMENT: The tumor shows complex papillary architecture with a multilayered syncytial-appearing epithelium. with abundant budding. The tumor cells are pleomorphic with relatively abundant eosinophilic. cytoplasm, a very high N:C ratio, and coarse vesicular chromatin with prominent eosinophilic. nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures and apoptotic cells are seen. The findings are most likely those of. a high-grade serous carcinoma, and the large cell size with eosinophilic cytoplasm suggests the. oxyphilic variant thereof. However, the differential diagnosis can include oxyphilic variants of clear. cell carcinoma or a high-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The absence of extra-ovarian tumor. given the size of the primary is also rather unusual for serous carcinoma. Serous carcinoma is. nonetheless favored as the overall growth pattern is most consistent with this diagnosis, and areas. with well-developed features of either clear cell or endometrioid adenocarcinoma are not seen. Additional stains were necessary to properly assess this case, and these were performed and. evaluated with the following results: -WT1: Positive. -p53: Positive, variable intensity. -ER: Negative. -PR: Focal, patchy positive. -CA125: Positive. The expression of WT1 is most consistent with an ovarian serous carcinoma, which is also supported. by the diffuse expression of p53 and CA125, and low-level or absent expression of PR and ER. respectively. Although p53 staining is diffuse, the intensity varies more than is typical of serous. carcinoma. Nonetheless, the diagnosis is not excluded by this pattern. In contrast, expression of. NT1 and diffuse p53 argues against clear cell carcinoma, and while some PAS-positive material is. resent, this is diastase-resistant and therefore not compatible with glycogen. At least some of the. material is mucin and stains with mucicarmine. The expression of WT1 and poor expression of ER. and PR also argue against endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

The external surface of the ovary. and tube is predominantly smooth, except for a vague, ill-defined, approximately 3 cm area on the. ovarian surface which is slightly irregular in texture. This area is inked in blue, and the remaining. surface is inked in black. Although irregular, no overt papillary excrescences are seen. In addition,. the fallopian tube resection margin is inked in green. The fallopian tube appears unremarkable, and. no discrete lesions are seen or palpated, and the fimbriae are lush. The ovary is sectioned to reveal. a soft, fleshy, gray-white, almost-solid interior with an irregular, up-to-6 cm apparently necrotic. cavity in the middle. The tumor is soft and has a grossly discernible papillary appearance. There is. also a single smooth-walled, 4 cm, unilocular cyst filled with a clear, yellow-brown fluid as well as an. adjacent 2.4 cm, unilocular, hemorrhagic cyst. This latter cyst directly underlies the blue-inked area. and contains multiple small papillary excrescences along the wall as well as a 1.5 cm, solid area with. a consistency similar to the rest of the bulk tumor. The fallopian tube is sectioned and appears. grossly unremarkable. A representative section of the tumor is submitted for frozen section diagnosis. as FS1, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette A1. In addition, approximately 150 gm. of the tumor is submitted for tissue banking. Additional representative sections are submitted as. follows: Cassette A2: Fallopian tube plus tumor.

NOTE: The origin of the tumor, a serous adenocarcinoma, is most likely of. ovarian origin, although there is some. degree of uncertainty. Key features. are (1) large size of the ovarian tumor and (2) WT-1 reactivity which is. usually positive in ovarian serous primaries, but usually negative in. endometrial serous primaries. While there was a past history of endometrial. tumor detected by pap smear, it is possible this is from cells shed by the. ovarian tumor that have passed through the reproductive canal. The tumor also. occupies half of the endometrial polyp, including its interior, which is not. typical for a metastasis, but certainly can be expected if present for some. period of time, The polyp arises in the lower uterine segment and has. prolapsed into the cervix. I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the aboye. specimen (s) and have rendered the above diagnosis (es). ADDENDUM 1: The tumor is reactive for P53 and WT1.

CINOMA INVOLVING ONE RESECTION MARGIN. By this signature, I attest that the above diagnosis is based upon my. personal examination of the slides(and/or other material indicated in the diagnosis). eport Electronically Reviewed and Signed Out By. Microscopic Description and Comment: Histologic sections from the left ovarian mass show. a poorly differentiated Mullerian adenocarcinoma. The majority of the tumor is present. in solid sheets and nests. Some of the tumor, however, exhibits definite glandular. differentiation with occasional areas of back to back glands diagnostic of endometrioid. differentiation. Other areas exhibit intraluminal complexity in the form of papilla with. markedly pleomorphic nuclei and numerous atypical mitotic figures consistent with serous. differentiation. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in and around the left fallopian tube,. in a small nodule in the right mesovarium, extensively involving the serosal aspect of the. uterus and deep paracervical tissue with superficial invasion of overlying myometrium, in. the omentum, on the serosal aspect of the appendix, in a mesenteric nodule, in a sigmoid. nodule, and in the pelvis. A segment of the sigmoid colon has been resected. This segment is. unoriented but one resection margin exhibits metastatic adenocarcinoma. History: The patient is. ith a pelvic mass. now undergoes evaluation. under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, with bilateral. salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, sigmoid resection with re-anastomosis, and. optimal tumor debulking.

Gross Description Received are eight containers, each labeled with the patient's name. The. first is further designated ""cul de sac tumor. It contains a 1 x 1 x 1 cm aggregate of. friable tan tissue. The second container is further designated ""uterus, cervix, BSO. It contains a 200. gram uterine corpus with attached adnexae and attached cervix. The left adnexa is largely. replaced by a 7 x 4 x 4 cm friable tan tumor mass. The tumor has a finely papillary. appearance. Attached to the tumor is a 3 cm in diameter smooth-lined cyst. Grossly, the. tumor appears to be adhesed and possibly invading the serosal surface of the left uterine. corpus. The fallopian tube, which measures 3 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter appears to. be uninvolved, although it is adherent to the tumor mass. The right adnexa consists of. a. 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm firm white and tan ovary with multiple corpora albicans and a 4 cm in. length and 0.8 cm in diameter fallopian tube. There does not appear to be any evidence. of tumor in the fallopian tube or the ovary; however, in the mesovarium, there is a 0.5. cm firm white nodule. The uterine corpus which measures 4.5 cm superior-inferior, 4 cm. cornu-cornu, and 4.5 cm anterior-posterior is adhesed to the left ovarian mass. Furthermore,. there are multiple nodules of tumor studding the serosal surface. The endometrial cavity. measures 2.5 x 2 cm with an endometrial thickness of 0.2 cm. The endometrium sounds to a. depth of 8 cm. The endometrial lining is remarkable for a 2 x 2 X 1 cm polyp protruding into. the endometrial cavity. Sectioning of the polyp reveals a central core with a firm white. lobulated appearance, measuring 2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The core of this polyp appears to arise. from the underlying myometrium and is consistent with a submucosal leiomyoma protruding. into the lumen of the cavity with an intact endometrial lining overlying the leiomyoma. There are also other intramural and subserosal unremarkable leiomyomas present, ranging. from 1 cm in greatest dimension to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. The myometrium is 2. cm. in thickness anteriorly and 1.4 cm in thickness posteriorly. The cervix, which measures. 3 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter with a round os measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, appears. to be unremarkable without evidence of papillary formations, masses or nodules.

The third container is further designated ""sigmoid tumor.' It contains a 4 x 4 x 4 cm. aggregate of friable tan tumor. The fourth container is further designated ""sigmoid colon. It contains an unoriented. segment of bowel measuring 9 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter with a serosal surface that. is extensively involved by friable tan tumor. The tumor appears to extend very close to. the resection margin. The mucosal surface appears to be unremarkable. Labeled: D1 - one. resection margin; D2 - other margin; D3 - random section with tumor. The fifth container is further designated ""pelvic tumor. It contains a 1 x 1 x 0.5. cm. aggregate of friable tan tumor. The sixth container is further designated ""mesentery nodule. It contains two portions of. 1. cm in diameter tissue covered with a glistening membrane. The seventh container is further designated ""appendix."" It contains an 8 cm in length and. 0.5 cm in diameter portion of appendix grossly involved by tumor at the serosa of the tip. Labeled G1, appendix including resection margin. The eighth container is further designated ""omentum. , It contains a 29 x 8 x 0.5 cm portion. of omentum grossly involved by multiple nodules of tumor ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 cm in. greatest dimension.

THE FOLLOWING SPECIMEN IS FREE OF TUMOR: M. VENTRAL HERNIA SAC. NOTE: While many areas in the tumor are solid (estimated 308), the tumor is. classified as grade 2 since less than 50% is solid. ADDENDUM 1: This addendum is issued to report the results for immunostaining for HER2/neu. oncoprotein. The test is performed at the request of. Immunostaining for HER2/neu (c-erbB-2) oncoprotein is performed on recut. sections of block A2 (""left ovary"") . The immunostaining is done using DAKO. rabbit anti-human c-erbB-2 oncoprotein which is an affinity-isolated antibody. (DAKO product number A0485) The immunostaining is performed after antigen. retrieval by heating the unstained sections at 95 degrees centigrade for 20. minutes in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 The primary antibody is used at a. dilution of 1:1500 (manual staining) or 1:2000 (autostainer), with an. incubation for one hour at 37 degrees centigrade. The Histostain Plus kit. (Zymed Laboratories) is used as the detection system. The histological. section consists predominantly of serous adenocarcinoma with areas of. papillary differentiation. The tumor has a variable immunostaining profile. The majority of the tumor has negligible staining of the cytoplasm or cell. membrane (score = 0) . There is a minority population of the tumor cells that. u1. has trace staining of the cytoplasm with mildly to moderately intense. circumferential staining of the cell membrane. These cells with. circumferential cell membrane staining are present as multiple foci scattered. throughout the tumor. This makes it difficult to estimate the overall tumor. population with the staining pattern indicative of weak overexpression of. HER2/neu oncoprotein, but I estimate that such cells account for approximately. 5% of the tumor cells. In summary, the serous adenocarcinoma present in the left ovary has a. subpopulation of tumor cells (approximately 5% of the total population) with. an immunostaining profile indicative of mild overexpression of HER2/neu. oncoprotein. I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above. specimen (s) and have rendered the above diagnosis (es)."

By this signature, I attest that the above diagnosis is based upon my. personal examination of the slides (and/or other material indicated in the diagnosis) -. Microscopic Description and Comment: Papillary serous adenocarcinoma is present in the right. and left ovaries. In the left ovary, the tumor predominantly involves paraovarian adhesions. In the right ovary, benign serous cystadenofibroma is present adjacent to invasive papillary. serous carcinoma. Extensive metastatic papillary serous adenocarcinoma is present in right. and left paratubal soft tissues, the omentum and in the snecimens labeled ""bladder flap,. cul-de-sac tumor, "" and ""umbilical nodule."". History: The patient is a. with a right ovarian mass on. ultrasound and an elevated CA143. operative procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, omentectomy,. total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and optimal tumor debulking. Specimen (s) Received: A: OMENTUM. B: BLADDER FLAP. C: CUL DE SAC TUMOR. D: HYSTERECTOMY, BSO. E: UMBILICAL NODULE. Gross Description The specimens are received in five containers of formalin, each labeled. with the patient's name. The first container is additionally labeled ""omentum. It. consists of a 40 x 15 x 5 cm omental cake extensively involved by a solid, tan-yellow tumor. mass. Labeled A1 - A3. The second container is labeled ""bladder flap. It consists of irregular grey-tan,. tumor-like tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm in aggregate. The third container is labeled ""cul-de-sac tumor. "" It consists of a 2.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm. grey-tan nodule, compatible with tumor. The fourth container is labeled ""uterus, cervix, BSO. It consists of a 92 gram, 7.5 x. 4 x 3 cm uterus with attached bilateral adnexae. The serosa of the uterus, except for the. presence of a subserosal leiomyoma, is smooth and unremarkable. The ectocervix measures. 3.5 cm in greatest diameter and is covered by a grey-tan, slightly hemorrhagic mucosa. The endocervix is 2.5 cm in length and has a slightly mucoid, yellow, mucosa that is free. of tumor. The endometrial cavity measures 2.5 x 1.5 cm and has an unremarkable tan-yellow. mucosa. The myometrium is composed of a coarsely trabeculated musculature, that, except for. the presence of a circumscribed, white, whorled, 7 mm leiomyoma is grossly unremarkable. The right ovary has previously been opened. It measures approximately 3 x 2 x 2 cm and. is apparently largely replaced by a unilocular cyst. The cyst contains a single solid. tan-yellow papillary area measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension and covering less than. 10% of the total cyst surface area. The remaining surface area is smooth, glistening and. unremarkable. The right fallopian tube measures 4.5 cm in length and has fimbria at the. distal end. There are three small tumor nodules in the paratubal soft tissues that measure. up to 8 mm in greatest dimension. The tube, appears grossly free of tumor. The left adnexal. structures are ill-defined grossly, due to the presence of numerous hemorrhagic adhesions. There appears to be a portion of ovary that measures 2 x 1 x 0.4 cm. There are nodular. excrescences on the surface but these appear to represent hemorrhagic exudate. Sectioning of. the ovary shows a normal-appearing grey-white stroma, without gross evidence of tumor. There. is also a distorted portion of fallopian tube that has fimbria distally and appears grossly. uninvolved by tumor. Labeled D1, anterior cervix; D2, anterior endomyometrium; D3, posterior. cervix; D4, posterior endomyometrium; D5, subserosal leiomyoma; D6 - D12, completely. embedded right adnexal tissue; D13 - D20 completely embedded left adnexal tissues. The fifth container is labeled ""umbilical nodule. It consists of an irregular 3 x 3 x 2 cm. fragment of fibrosis tisue.

Intraoperative Consultation: #2, section of umbilical hernia ""nodule"", resection - pick up. only. FS1 - Left ovary mass. - ""Adenocarcinoma"" by. Microscopic Description and Comment: Histologic sections from the left ovarian mass show. a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumor is present predominantly in sheets of. cells with large vesicular nuclei and occasional tumor giant cells. In some areas the. tumor is present in thin single file cords invading a desmoplastic stroma. Other areas show. rhabdoid features with perinuclear eosinophilic cytoplasm. A significant minority of the. tumor forms well-defined endometrioid-type glands. These glands appear to be present in. an adenofibromatous stroma. Metastatic adenocarcinoma extensively involves the lymphatics. of the myometrium but no serosal implants are present. The endometrium has been entirely. submitted and exhibits a disordered proliferative pattern but no carcinoma is identified. The right ovary (enitrely submitted) and both fallopian tubes are free of carcinoma. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in periappendiceal soft tissue. The appendix also. contains a focal mucocele but no carcinoma involving epithelium is present. Metastatic. adenocarcinoma is present in 2 of 2 right external iliac lymph nodes, 2 of 2 right obturator. lymph nodes, lof 2 left external iliac lymph nodes, 2 of 6 left obturator lymph nodes, 2 of. 2 right peri-aortic lymph nodes, and 1 of 1 left peri-aortic lymph nodes. One right common. iliac lymph node is free of carcinoma. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is present in. Printed from. the specimen labeled ""umbilical hernia and nodule. The single submitted section from the. specimen labeled ""small bowel mesenteric mass"" appears to represent near total replacement. of a large lymph node The omentum is free of carcinoma. Given the somewhat unusual morphologic features immunostains were performed. The tumor is. negative for gross cystic disease fluid protein an antibody that stains approximately 60 to. 80% of breast carcinomas. The tumor is focally positive for S-100 and is strongly positive. for CA-125 in the better differentiated endometrioid areas. Although the morphologic. features and tumor distribution are somewhat unusual, in the absence of another primary. tumor these features are consistent with a mullerian (ovarian) primary. has reviewed selected slides and concurs with this interpretation.

Intraoperative Consultation: An Intraoperative non-microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: ""Brought to frozen is a 'right tube and. ovary,' consisting of an 80 gram, 9.5 x 3 X 8.2 cm multicystic and solid mass. Numerous excrescenses are present on. the surface of the ovary. Sectioned to show a complex, multicystic mass without identifiable residual normal ovarian. parenchyma. Portion frozen as 'FS1.'

Rest for permanents,"". FS1; Ovary, right, biopsy. ""Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. favor Mullerian,"" by. FS2: Soft tissue, rectal nodule, blopsy. Page: 2 of 5. Microscopic Description and Comment: Histologic evaluation of the ovarian mass shows poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma. While the majority of. the tumor shows typical serous features, focal areas have cytologic features reminiscent of neuroendocrine. differentiation including nuclear molding and a lack of prominent nucleoli; these areas also show immunoreactivity for. the neuroendocrine markers chromogranin and synaptophysin (immunoreactivity with pan-cytokeratin is also noted). Focal expression of neuroendocrine markers in serous adenocarcinoma has been described in the literature, however,. Examination of the specimen labeled ""left pelvic lymph node,"" which was entirely submitted for histologic examination,. shows metastatic poorly differentlated serous adenocarcinoma. Fragments of lymphoid tissue are present, but there is. no definitive lymph node architecture. The findings could represent a lymph node that has been effaced by metastatic. disease, or a soft tissue tumor deposit of adenocarcinoma with a lymphocytic response. Clinical correlation is required. History: The patient is a. with an ovarian mass. Operative procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, total. abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and tumor debulking.

COMMENT: This high-grade primary ovarian (bilateral ovarian) serous carcinoma. exhibits predominantly solid growth (with a ""undifferentiated""-like. appearance), and also exhibits papillary growth and focal glandular. growth. both fallopian tubes exhibit secondary involvement by. serous carcinoma. In addition, the left fallopian tube shows and. area of intraepithelial/intramucosal carcinoma, which may be primary. to that site. Intraluminal aggregates of serous carcínoma are also. present in the left fallopian tube. There is extensive lympho--. vascular space invasion by carcinoma in all involved sites,. including the uterus and cervix. Within the uterus, the endometrial. mucosal involvement by serous carcinoma is predominantly within. lymphatic spaces. There are, however, a few small foci of mucosal. involvement extrinsic to lymphatics. While the latter might. represent primary uterine papillary serous carcinoma, the alternate. possibility that the endometrial deposits of tumor within the. uterus represent secondary extension into the mucosa from involued. lymphatic spaces is favored. Ill all addicional routinely stained sections have been. incorporated in the final diagnosis. HISTORY: Ovarian carcinoma. MICROSCOPIC: See Diagnosis. GROSS: 1. RIGHT I P NODE.

It is lined by benign ciliated. epithelium is most consistent with a benign serous cyst adenoma. On the surface of this cyst, however, are small. nodules of metastatic high grade serous adenocarcinoma. The bulk of the malignant tumor in this case is located in. the omentum with small implants on both fallopian tubes, left ovary, and on the serosal surface of the uterus. These. findings are most consistent with a primary peritoneal carcinoma. History: with ascites and a pelvic mass. Operative procedure: Examination under. anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic. omentectomy, and optimal tumor debulking. Specimen(s) Received: A: RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY. B: UTERUS, CERVIX, LEFT TUBE AND OVARY. C: OMENTUM. Gross Description;. The specimens are received in three formalin-filled containers, each labeled. The first container is. labeled right tube and ovary."" It contains a tissue cassette labeled ""FS1"" that holds a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0,3 cm piece of. yellow-tan tissue. Also in the container is a previously inked and sectioned right adnexa, consisting of a 7.3 x 4.7 x 4.5. cm multicystic ovary, and a 6.3 x 0.7 cm fallopian tube. There is a 0.6 x 0,4 x 0.4 cm white-tan, firm nodule on the. surface of the ovary. In addition, the serosal surface of the ovary and fallopian tube are studded with nodules ranging. from 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 0.5 x 0.3 cm, as described in the intraoperative non-microscopic consultation. The ovary is. sectioned to show a 4 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm multiloculated cystic mass with a white-tan, smooth inner lining. There are no. solid areas within the cystic mass. The uninvolved ovary is sectioned to show yellow-tan, unremarkable ovarian. parenchyma. The fallopian tube is sectioned to show white-tan mucosa with a patent lumen. Labeled A2 to A7 - ovary. with cystic mass (A4 - serosal nodule); A8 - fallopian tube. The second container is labeled ""uterus, cervix, left tube and ovary."" It contains a 43 gram uterus with attached cervix. The uterus measures 7 cm from superior to inferior, 4 cm from cornu to cornu, and 3 cm from anterior to posterior. The. serosal surface of the uterus shows fibrous adhesions anteriorly. However, it is smooth and shiny posteriorly. The 2 x. 2 cm tan ectocervix has multiple areas of red-brown pinpoint hemormhages with a 0.6 cm external os. The 1.7 cm long. endocervical canal is lined by pink-tan mucosa and has scattered Nabothian cysts, the largest measuring 0,4 cm. The. Page: 2 of 3. 3.5 x 1.2 cm endometrial cavity is pink-tan and unremarkable. The endometrium is 0.2 cm thick; the myometrium is 0.8. cm thick. The myometrium contains three well circumscribed, tan-white, firm lesions with whorled cut surfaces, free of. hemorrhage and necrosis, measuring 1 cm, 0.6 cm, and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, consistent with leiomyomas. The largest lelomyoma shows focal calcification. There is also a 0.5 x 0.3 cm subserosal leiomyoma anteriorly. Also in. the container is a detached, 10 gram left adnexa including a 2.5 x 2,2 x 1 cm ovary and a 4 x 0.6 cm attached fallopian. tube. The surface of the ovary and fallopian tube shows extensive fibrous adhesions. There are multiple paratubal. cysts, the largest measuring 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The ovary is sectioned to show yellow-tan unremarkable. ovarian parenchyma. The fallopian tube is sectioned to show white-tan mucosa with a patent lumen. There are no. discrete lesions.

Gross Description. The specimen is received in seven parts, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. Parts. A and B are received fresh. Parts C-F are received in formalin. Primary surgery. 2 of 4. Part A, additionally labeled ""omentum,"" consists of a section of red-tan, fibrofatty and firm tissue. measuring. 13.0 x 13.0 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is studded with multiple yellow-tan to yellow-white nodules. ranging in. size from 0.2 cm up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. A 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm portion of the specimen is. taken for tumor banking, and representative sections are submitted in cassettes A1-A2. Part B, additionally labeled ""right ovary plus tube,"" consists of a partially cystic, partially solid structure. with no identifiable ovary and attached fallopian tube, which measures 11.0 x 9.0 x 4.0 cm and weighs. 238.2 gm. The cystic portion measures 4.0 cm in greatest dimension and has a cyst wall that ranges. between 0.1 and 0.2 cm in greatest dimension, and has two exophytic papillary-like structures on the. external surface, which measure 2.0 and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, respectively. Deep to these, the. specimen is solid and has a fleshy, yellow-tan, irregular parenchyma. The solid portion measures 4.0 x 3.0. x. 2.0 cm. The attached fallopian tube measures 3,5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in average diameter, is smooth,. pink-tan, and otherwise unremarkable. The external surface of the specimen is inked in black. A. representative section of the solid portion is submitted as frozen section 1 with the remnant in cassette B1. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows: Cassette B2: Representative sections of fallopian tube. Cassette B3: Representative sections of larger mass on exterior surface of cyst. Cassette B4: Representative sections of smaller exophytic mass on external surface of cyst. Cassettes B5-B6; Additional representative sections of cyst. Cassettes B7-B10: Representative sections of solid portion of cyst. Part C, labeled ""uterus, cervix, left ovary and tube and rectosigmoid colon,"" consists of a uterus, attached. cervix, fallopian tube and attached soft tissue tumor mass, and attached short segment of sigmoid colon. The uterine specimen measures 7.5 cm from superior to inferior, 5.5 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.0 cm. from anterior to posterior. The cervix measures 3,5 cm from side to side, 3.0 cm from anterior to posterior. and approximately 2.0 cm in length. The serosal surface of the uterus is tan-brown, smooth and glistening,. with areas of subserosal hemorrhage scattered throughout. The cervical mucosa is tan-white, smooth and. glistening, again with small areas of punctate mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage. The specimen probes. to 6.5 cm and is opened along the lateral surfaces. The endocervical mucosa is pale tan and measures 1.0. mm in thickness. The endometrium is also pale tan, and free of polyps and masses. The endometrium. measures 2.0 mm in thickness. The myometrium is serially sectioned, revealing no mural lesions. The. myometrium averages 1.3 cm in thickness. Two nodular masses of tissue are attached to the left surface of. the uterus. The serosal surfaces of both are similar, each with a very nodular contour, covered by a. tan-brown serosa, and grossly obvious tumor nodules. Grossly, it is difficult to ascertain which of these. two masses contains the ovary, however one does appear to be attached to the uterus by a tubular. structure, likely the fallopian tube. This portion of tissue measures 7.5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm and the adjacent. tubular structure measures 2.5 cm in length, with an average diameter of 1.0 cm. Serial sections through. the mass reveal no grossly obvious ovarian tissue, though a lumen filled with necrotic tissue is identified in. the previously-described tubular structure. The adjacent mass of tissue has a similar gross appearance. and measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. One portion of the specimen contains a thin-walled cyst filled with. translucent fluid, measuring 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. On cut section, the specimen is composed of. multiple nodules of tan-white, firm tissue ranging in size between 0,5 and 2.0 cm. Adherent to the uterus. and ovary is a segment of large bowel measuring 14.0 cm in length with an average diameter of 4.0 cm. The serosal surface is diffusely caked with tumor nodules ranging in size between 0.2 and 0.5 cm, though. with confluence of tumor in other areas. What is thought to be the proximal margin is received stapled. shut, with the distal margin remaining open. Upon opening, a scant, tan-brown mucoid material is. identified. The mucosa is pale tan, and unremarkable. Sections are submitted as follows: Cassette C1: Anterior cervix. Cassette C2: Posterior cervix. Cassette C3: Anterior endomyometrium. Cassette C4: Posterior endomyometrium. Cassettes C5-C6; Sections of putative ovary. Primary surgery. 3 of 4. Cassette C7: Putative fallopian tube. Cassettes C8-C9; Mass adjacent to ovary. Cassette C10: Proximal bowel margin. Cassette C11: Distal bowel margin. Cassette C12: Sections through unremarkable bowel mucosa. Cassette C13: Representative sections of small bowel serosa. Part D, labeled rectum, staples proximal,"" consists of a single, short segment of rectum measuring 6.5 cm. in length with an average diameter of 2.5 cm. Attached to the specimen is a large amount of very irregular. and fragmented brown-tan, fibrous connective tissue measuring 8.5 cm in width x 4.0 x 2.5 cm. The. surrounding soft tissue is inked prior to opening of the staple surface at the proximal margin. The. specimen is opened to reveal pale tan-brown, glistening mucosa with no grossly identifiable masses or. lesions. A section of the proximal margin is submitted in cassette D1. A section of the distal margin is. submitted in cassette D2. A random section is submitted in cassette D3. The attached fibrous connective. tissue is serially sectioned, revealing a pericolonic mass of tan-white tumor measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The tumor mass approaches the proximal margin of resection within 1.0-2.0 mm, and the lateral margin of. resection within 3.0 mm. A representative section is submitted in cassette D4. Part E, labeled ""transverse colon tumor,"" consists of an irregular and fragmentary tan-brown, polypoid. mass measuring 3.4 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned, and representative sections are. submitted in cassette E1. Part F, labeled ""small bowel mesentery,"" consists of a single ovoid nodule of yellow-tan, soft tissue. measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette F1. Part G, labeled ""bladder peritoneum,"" consists of an irregular and fragmentary tan-brown, polypoid mass. measuring 3.4 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned, and representative sections are. submitted in cassette G1. Fee Codes: I. Primary surgery. 4 of 4."

The specimen is labeled appendix and is received in formalin. It consists of a very slightly curved. vermiform appendix which is 4.8 cm in length and has a maximum diameter of 0.6 cm. The serosal. surface is tan smooth and shiny. The appendiceal wall is intact. The mesoappendix is unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in cassette A1 (proximal margin inked). B. The specimen is labeled gallbladder and is received in formalin. It consists of a deflated but intact. gallbladder which is 11 cm in length and up to 3.8 cm in diameter. The free serosal surface is red-violet. and smooth. The cystic duct is patent and there are two firm pale tan cystic duct nodes which are up to 0.6. cm in maximum dimension. The gallbladder wall is generally 0.5 cm in thickness. The mucosa varies from. yellow-tan to pale red and is finally granular throughout. There is partial septation of the gallbladder neck. as well as an area of septation at the fundus. No calculi are present. There are no palpable nodules within. the gastric wall. Representative sections re submitted. Section summary: B1) cystic duct margin, cystic duct. nodes, gallbladder neck, B2) gallbladder body and fundus. C. The specimen is labeled portal lymph node and consists of a 2x 1.9 x 0.8 cm fragment of yellow-tan to. paie red tissue. On sectioning there is a single lymph node measuring approximately1.: cm in maximum. dimension. The node is sectioned and touch imprints are obtained. The specimen is entirely submitted in. cassette C1. D. The specimen is labeled Whipple procedure and is received without fixative. It consists of a composite. resection of tissue which includes a 5 x 3 X 1.8 cm wedge resection of distal gastric tissue including pylorus. and a 27 cm segment of duodenum. There is a firm portion of pancreatic head which measures 6.3 x 4.7. x. 5 cm. The anterior-superior surface of the pancreas is inked blue, the anterior-inferior surface is inked. green, and the posterior surface is inked black. The free serosal surface of the gastric resection is pale red and smooth. There is a moderate amount of. Printed: This report continues. - Page 3/5. 'age 3.

The free serosal. surface of the distal duodenum is tan with some slight surgical disruption but there are no areas of. perforation. The specimen is opened to reveal the gastric mucosa is flat, tan to pale red, slightly granular. There is some slight irregularity of the mucosa at the pylorus but no true ulceration. The circumference at. the proximal duodenum is 6 cm. The ampulla is located 10 cm distal to the pylorus (11.5 cm from. proximal margin and 17 cm from the distal margin). A wire stent protrudes from the ampulla. Sectioning. of. the pancreas along the common bile duct reveals gritty tan-white, firm, poorly delineated neoplastic tissue. in the head of the pancreas measuring 2.8 cm in maximum dimension. This neoplastic process grossly. appears to be 1.8 cm from the ampulla. The pancreatic resection margin and the bile duct are marked. with sutures. Sectioning reveals that the neoplasm is grossly 1.3 cm from the pancreatic resection margin. The neoplasm is in close proximity to the anterior-superior surface as well as the anterior-inferior surface. It. is grossly 0.3 cm from the closest posterior pancreatic surface. Further sectioning of the pancreas reveals a. prominent diverticulum-like out-pouching of the duodenum 2 cm proximal to the ampulla. This. diverticular out pouching grossly extends into the head of the pancreas but does not appear to have. neoplastic involvement. The pancreas tissue away from the neoplasm is firm and yellowish. There are. scattered peripancreatic nodes which are up to 2.5 cm. The peripancreatic tissue is dissected for further. nodes. Just distal to the ampulla, the circumference of the duodenum is 7 cm and at the distal duodenal margin. circumference is 5.5 cm. The duodenal mucosa is yellow-tan with normal appearing mucosal folds and no. palpable areas of nodularity are present within the duodenal wall. There is very little duodenal adipose. tissue present.

Comment: These frozen section diagnoses/results were communicated to and acknowledged by Dr. I.D., have performed the intraoperative consultations and issued the above. diagnosis. Gross Description. A. Specimen A is received fresh labeled ""hepatic artery lymph node."" The specimen consists of. a 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0, moderately firm gray tan irregular lymph node which is serially sectioned and entirely. submitted as A1-A2. B. Specimen B is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled ""subtotal pancreatectomy and. spienectomy."" The specimen consists of a subtotal pancreatectomy (8.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm) attached to a. grossly unremarkable spleen (14.0 x 8.0 x 6.0 cm). Both specimens are adherent to a moderate. amount of fat. The pancreatic margin of resection is stapled. The staples are removed and the. underlying tissue is removed tangentially and entirely submitted on frozen section as FSB1. The. pancreatic duct is markedly dilated but is probe-patent for approximately 2 cm where it is filled with. a. soft brown tan protruding tissue (possible tumor). The end of the pancreas which attaches to the. spleen is markedly indurated and exhibits a gray white smooth ill-defined mass (3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm). abutting the soft tissue margin of resection and is approximately 4 cm from the pancreatic margin of. resection. The mass at this point totally occludes the pancreatic duct. The mass occupies. approximately 75% of the pancreas. The random pancreatic parenchyma is lobulated gray tan grossly. unremarkable. The capsule of the spleen is brown tan and intact. The cut surface exhibits a soft red brown tissue. with grossly unremarkable parenchyma. Sectioning of the adipose tissue isolates no definitive fymph. nodes. A representative section of the tumor is submitted to Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections are submitted as: B2: Mirror image of tumor submitted to Tissue Bank. B3-B6: Sections of tumor showing relationship to soft tissue margin of resection.

There are no stones. There are scant hemorrhagic luminal. contents. No mucosal or mural lesions are noted. Block summary : F1 - resection margin with cystic duct and artery and. representative section from fundus. F2 - representative sections from mid body and neck. Container G is additionally labeled ""pancreaticoduodenectomy. with short stitch at uncinate, long stitch at SMA. "" The. container holds a standard Whipple specimen with the following. measurements: distal stomach 7.5 X 5 cm; portion of greater. omentum attached to stomach 11 X 4.5 X 1.5 cm; duodenum 24 cm in. length X 2.5 cm in average diameter (after fixation) ; pancreatic. head and neck 6 X 4.5 X 4.5 cm. A long stitch marks the. pancreatic margin at the SMA and a short stitch marks the. uncinate process margin. Inking common bile duct=yellow,. resection margin at pancreatic neck=blue, uncinate. process=black, peripancreatic soft tissue=green. The serosal surface of the stomach and duodenum is tan and. smooth. The pancreatic head is very firm. Opening the duodenum. reveals erythematous coarse and thickened mucosa at the ampulla. The remainder of the stomach and duodenal mucosa is beige/tan,. unremarkable, and appropriately folded. The pancreas is. sectioned revealing a 4.2 X 4.0 X 4.0 cm white/tan/yellow solid. firm mass occupying most of the pancreatic parenchyma in the. specimen. The mass has areas of necrotic cystic change along the. dorsal pancreatic surface. The tumor constricts the common bile. duct to lumen diameter of 1-2 mm. It comes up into the ampulla. and undermines the duodenal mucosa. The tumor infiltrates into. the duodenal wall proximal to the ampulla as well, extending up. to and possibly into the submucosa. The tumor does not involve. the pylorus. There is relatively poor demarcation between the. mass and the pancreatic neck. To assess distance to pancreatic. neck margin the resection surface of the neck is inked blue and. sections are taken perpendicular to this surface (true surgical. margin at the neck is superseded by the en face G2 section) . The. mass extends to the inked uncinate margin at short stitch and. the margin at the SMA at long stitch. It also abuts. peripancreatic soft tissue. Distance to mucosal margins: stomach. margin 16 cm, duodenal margin 13 cm, common bile duct margin 1.5. cm. A number of firm lymph nodes are identified in the. peripancreatic soft tissue ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.6 cm,. submitted per block summary. Tumor was collected by Tissue. Block Summary : G1 - common bile duct margin, en face. G2 - pancreatic neck margin, en face. G3 - gastric mucosal margin, en face. G4 - duodenal mucosal margin, en face. G5 - lymph node candidate at the common bile duct, bisected. G6 - perpendicular sections to the pancreatic neck (inked blue). G7 - ampulla section.

G10-G11 representative sections to green inked pancreatic. surface, G10 near common bile duct, G11. near the portal vein groove. G12 - ulcerated duodenal mucosa at ampulla. G13 - tumor in relation to the common bile duct, two sections. G14 - tumor undermining duodenal wall. G15 - pylorus, representative section. G16 - representative sections of stomach and duodenum. G17 - multiple peripancreatic lymph node candidates. G18 - multiple peripancreatic lymph node candidates at base of. common bile duct. G19 - multiple peripancreatic lymph node candidates. G20-G22 - multiple perigastric lymph nodes candidates, each. cassette, greater omentum. Light Microscopy: Light microscopic examination is performed by. The frozen. section diagnoses are confirmed. Permanent sections show invasive ductal adenocarcinoma with mucinous. features within pancreatic head, extending into peripancreatic fat,. extending through the duodenal wall to undermine the mucosa, and. extending posteriorly to the pancreatic posterior soft tissue margin. at the site of the SMA and the portal vein. Definite nodal metastasis. is identified in block G18. Two soft tissue nodules in block G17 are. interpreted as most consistent with complete effacement by metastatic. carcinoma."

Specimen D is labeled ""Whipple, frozen section on retroperitoneal margin, pancreatic margin,. bile duct"", The specimen consists of a pancreatic head (7 x x 2.5 cm) with attached duodenum. (16.0 cm in length and up to 4.5 cm in circumference at the level of distal resection margin) and distal. portion of stomach (4.5 cm in length and up to 10.0 cm in circumference at the level of stapled gastric. resection margin). The serosa of the stomach is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, while the outer. surface of the duodenum is shaggy with a small amount of fibroadipose tissue attached. There is. also. a small amount of omental adipose tissue attached to the gastric wall. The peripheral aspects of the. pancreatic head are composed of a small amount of adipose tissue which is ranging from 0.1 to 0.3. cm in thickness. Prior to sectioning, the specimen is inked as follows: Anterior aspect of the pancreatic head: Green. Medial aspect (groove): Red. Stapled retroperitoneal margin: Orange. The remainder of the posterior aspect of the pancreatic head: Black. Parenchymal resection margin: Black. Common bile duct margin: Blue. On opening. the duodenum reveais an irregular, ill defined, sessile, focal hemormagic tumor (1.5 x 1. cm) which involves ampulla of Vater On sectioning, the tumor measures up to 0,5 cm in depth and. appears to involve adjacent portion of pancreatic head.

Sections through the Ampulla show apancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma secondarily involving the. Ampulla and common bile duct. A precursor lesion for the carcinoma is not identified in the Ampulla,. duodenum or bile duct. The carcinoma, however, is centered on the main pancreatic duct. The. adjancet pancreatic parenchyma hsows PanIN 3. These findings support the interpretation of this as a. pancreatic ductal primary, rather than an Ampullary or common bile duct primary. Ancillary Testing. Immunohistochemical stains with appropriate controls were performed on block B9. These results. show strong and diffuse expression for MUC-1, and no expression for MUC-2 and CDX2. These. results are consistent with a pancreatobiliary phenotype. Key Pathological Findings. SPECIMEN: Head of pancreas. Duodenum. Stomach. Common bile duct. Gallbladder.

The specimen is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled bile duct, pancreas,. duodenum."" The specimen consists of a resected portion of the pancreatic head (4.5 x 4 x 3 cm) and. attached duodenum (12 cm in length and 6 cm in greatest circumference). The serosal surface of the. duodenum is brown-tan and smooth. Upon opening, the tumen contains a moderate amount of. viscous bile. The mucosal surface of the duodenum exhibits normal folds with no gross evidence of. polyps or nodularity. The pancreatic margin resection is marked with black ink, the portal vein groove is marked with blue. ink and the retroperitoneal surface is marked with green ink. There is no stapled line grossly present. that would indicate the superior mesentery artery. A palpable pancreatic mass is identified. The. pancreatic duct is not probe patent and is totally occluded by the presence of the tumor. Serial. sectioning into the pancreas reveals a firm, yellow-gray, ill-defined mass. (4 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm), which abuts the retroperitoneal surface/uncinate process. Grossly the mass does. appear to involve the common bite duct, which is probe patent and somewhat dilated with an inserted. catheter. Grossly the mass does appear to involve the duodenal wall extending to the mucosal. surface and grossly involving the ampulla of Vater. There is a minimal amount of grossly uninvolved. pancreatic tissue. A section of the minimal amount of attached adipose tissue isolates 2 moderately. firm, round, tan, irregular lymph nodes, which measure 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph. nodes are isolated adjacent to the pancreas. A representative frozen section is taken and submitted. as FSA1.

Whipple. B. Gallbladder. C. Pancreatic new margin. Clinical History/Operative Dx: Pancreatic mass. The specimen is labeled as pancreatic new margin; suture marks new margin. Initially received in the. fresh state for frozen section analysis is a portion of pancreas, 2.0 cm in length and 2.0 x 3.4 cm. A suture. marks the new margin which is additionally marked blue. The new margin is trimmed and submitted en. face for frozen section analysis with residual frozen tissue submitted in C1 for permanent sections. The. pancreatic duct is 0.3 cm in diameter and probe patent. Sectioning demonstrates yellow-gray glandular. parenchyma with mild hemorrhagic congestion and without grossly residual tumor. The remainder of the. pancreas is submitted in a sequential fashion, proximal (old margin) to distal (new margin) in C2-C5. A. scant amount of peripancreatic fat is examined and is suspicious for discrete lymph node content,. sectioned and submitted in C6. Intraoperative Diagnosis: A. Whipple contents: Pancreatic margin positive for adenocarcinoma, bile duct margin is negative for. carcinoma. C. New pancreatic margin: Negative for carcinoma,. intraoperative interpretation(s). was/were performed and rendered at. Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled Whipple contents. Received in formalin, is a generous portion of tissue. consistent with a Whipple procedure specimen: a distal resection of stomach, 5.7 cm lesser, 11.0 cm. greater, a 25.5 cm length of duodenum averaging 3.3 cm in diameter, and the pancreas includes the. head measuring 2.4 cm in length, 4.6 cm superior-inferior. and 4.6 cm anterior-posterior/ uncinate margin. The gastric and small bowel segment demonstrates a semi-congested, light pink to deep red appearance. The pancreas is palpably soft to dense towards the superior-posterior periphery. The margins of the. pancreas are now differentially inked as follows: Anterior surface: Yellow,. Inferior surface: Green,. Superior margin: Blue,. Posterior margin/uncinate: Black,. Printed: This report continues. Acct No. Pathology Report - Page 3/5. Page 3 Doc# 1. FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. Pancreatic notch surface: Red. The common bile duct extends 1.3 and 0.9 cm in diameter, with a probe patent lumen into the smail. bowel segment. The pancreatic duct is unable to probe for patency with the CBD or small bowel lumen. The distal pancreatic margin is trimmed and submitted en face for frozen section analysis on one chuck. with the residual frozen tissue submitted in A1 for permanent sections; the common bile duct margin is. trimmed and submitted en face for frozen section analysis on a second chuck with the residual frozen. tissue submitted in A2 for permanent sections. The gastric and small bowel segments are now opened; the luminal contents are cleared revealing. semi-congested, light pink to proximally deep red, gastric mucosa without discrete lesion. The small bowel. segment demonstrates prominent, light pink and tan, circular plica that is increasingly softened and. congested toward the distal margin of resection. The ampulla of Vater is oriented 5.3 cm distal to the. pylorus and greater than 18.0 cm from the distal small bowel margin of resection. The ampulla. demonstrates slightly raised and granular appearance. Initial sectioning through the pancreas reveals an. ill-defined, dense, grossly fibrotic, light gray and pink, mass lesion, measuring upwards of 3.0 x 2.3 x 1.8. cm, and predominantly positioned in the superior-posterior aspect of the pancreas, within 0.1 cm of the. superior, 0.3 cm of the posterior, 0.7 cm of the anterior margins, and within 0.1 cm of the surface of the. pancreatic notch. The mass lesion appears to abut the common bile duct, however, the mucosa is. glistening to wrinkled, light gray and deep red, without gross involvement. The lesion is grossly within 0.1. cm of the distal pancreatic margin, formally removed for frozen section analysis. The pancreatic duct. narrows to 0.1 cm towards the small bowel length and is possibly obliterated by tumor. The grossly. uninvolved pancreas demonstrates a pronounced, lobular-glandular, pink-yellow gross architecture, that. becomes increasingly fatty towards the inferior anterior periphery. Initial examination of the peripancreatic fat reveais twelve lymph node candidates ranging from 0.15 cm. to 1.5 cm, rubbery, light gray to deep red. Initial examination of the perigastric fat does not reveal. additional lymph node candidacy. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic evaluation.

As stated in the original. report, this pancreas is involved by ductal adenocarcinoma. The neoplasm shows. discontiuous spread and appears to arise from a background of high grade pancreatic. ductal dysplasia, with tumor surrounding dilated ductal elements (4H and 41). There is. periampullary involvement (4F). The lack of continuity between foci makes evaluation. of tumor size difficult, but it appears greater than 2 cm overall. Perineural tumor is. present. There are multiple peripheral foci consistent with atrophic change, some. associated with inflammation. The designated surgical margins (1-3) are negative for. diagnostic dysplasia or malignancy. The permanent sections of the bile duct (4G),. taken from the Whipple specimen, show foci of glandular dysplasia in a background of. inflammation (particularly in the deeper levels). There is no involvement by carcinoma,. however. The true margin was submitted at the time of surgery (specimen #1) and is. negative. All examined lymph nodes are negative for diagnostic metastatic disease. ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS: 1. Bile duct margin, biopsy: - Negative for diagnostic high grade dysplasia or malignancy. 2. Pancreatic neck margin, biopsy: - Negative for diagnostic high grade dysplasia or malignancy. 3. Pancreatic uncinate margin, biopsy: - Negative for diagnostic high grade dysplasia or malignancy; atrophy. 4. Pancreas, distal stomach and proximal small bowel, Whipple resection: Ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas, moderately differentiated. - Resection margins negative (see above discussion). - Seventeen (17) peripancreatic lymph nodes, NEGATIVE for metastatic. carcinoma. 5. Stent (gross only): - Plastic tubing, consistent with stent. 6. Lymph nodes, celiac, regional resection: Two (2) lymph nodes, NEGATIVE for metastatic carcinoma. 7. Lymph node, portal, biopsy: - One (1) lymph node, NEGATIVE for metastatic carcinoma. Carcinoma of Pancreas Summary.

Gross Description: A. Part A designated gallbladder. Received in formalin is a previously disrupted, deflated gallbladder, 7.8. x 3.2x 1.2 cm. The serosa is glistening, fatty pink and tan. There are two paracystic duct lymph node. candidates are 0.3 and 0.4 cm each. The cystic duct margin demonstrates a narrow 1 mm lumen, difficult. to probe for patency, however, upon sectioning does not appear obstructed. The lumen contains a. residual amount of viscous dark green bile without calculi; no calcull are present within the container. The. mucosa is velvety, dark green with few raised yellow flecks without grossly unusual areas of change. suggestive of neoplasia. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic evaluation, including. representation of the cystic duct margin (orange), lymph node, mid fundus and dome of fundus in A1. B. Part 8 designated common bile duct lymph node. Received In formalin is a rubbery pink and tan lymph. node candidate measuring 1.1 x 0.6 x 0,5 cm. The lymph node and surrounding fat is now bisected and. submitted together in B1. This report continues (FINAL). Printed: C. Part C designated Whipple procedure. Initially received in a fresh state for frozen section analysis is a. generous portion of tissue, consistent with a Whipple procedure specimen. Il consists of a distal portion of. the antrum of the stomach, 12.0 cm along the greater curvature and 7.8 cm on the lesser, and up to 7.0. cm in diameter at the proximal surgical margin of resection; the small bowel is 21.0 cm in length with an. average diameter of 2.5 cm and up to 3.1 cm at the proximity of the pancreatic head; the pancreas. includes the head and portion of the body 5.7 cm in length, 5.0 cm Inferior-superlor, 4.2 cm. anterior-posterior. The common bile duct is obscurred by peripancreatic fat, and extends out to 1.8 cm, is. markedly narrow, 0.35 cm diameter. The CBD probe patent to a depth of 2.5 cm. FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. The gastric and small bowel is now opened, and examination of the small bowel demonstrates prominent,. semi-congested pink and tan circular plica, with the apparent ampulla of Vater oriented 6,4 cm distal to. the pylorus, and Is obscured by a ralsed, dusky red lesion measuring 1.3 x 0.8 cm. The AV through the. pancreatic duct is probe patent. Several attempts to probe the AV with the common bile duct is. unsuccessful. The CBD and distal pancreatic margin are submitted for frozen section analysis, the residual. frozen tissue submilled en face for permanent sections. The pancreas is initially bisected through the. ampulla of Vater. towards the distal margin, revealing a poorly demarcated, dense, pink-gray tumor mass. measuring upwards of 3.1 x 3.0 x 2.2 cm, and grossly approaching within 2.8 cm of the distal margin of. the pancreas, and 2.8 cm from the common bile duct margin and grossly approaching within 0.5 cm of the. pancreatic notch/adventitlal margin. The length of the common bile duct is opened, revealing a light pink. and tan mucosa that is roughly kinked within the head of the pancreas, and routes parallel to the. pancreatic duct and inserts 0.3 cm from the pancreatic duct into the ""ampulia of Vater"". The tumor mass. approaches wilhin 0.5 cm of the edge of the CBD. The tumor is primarily oriented within the head of the. pancreas with discrete contiguous relationship with the ampulla of Vater. In addition, 2.0 cm proximal to the ampulla of Vater, the small bowel demonstrates a distincily raised,. granular area of density, that upon sectioning reveals evidence of an accessory duct with associated. firmness suspicious for tumor (C7-C8). The area appears to grossly approach within 0.5 cm of the superior. edge of the radial surface. 1.0 cm of the posterior surface. 0.3 cm of the Inferior surface, and 0.7 cm of the. anterior surface. The surrounding pancreatic parenchyma is admixed fatly and glandular, pink and tan. No additional tesions are appreciated along the small bowel length, however, the pyloric ridge. demonstrates raised granular changes. The gastric mucosa is wrinkled, erythematous light pink and tan,. however, abruptly transitions to severely congested, deep red-brown throughout the proximal two-thirds of. the gastric antrum. No additional lesions appreciated. Initial examination of the peripancreatic fat reveals twenty additional lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 cm. 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm each. Examination of the lesser and greater gastric fat does not reveal gross lymph. node content. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation, with the specimen. retained in. solution to enhance future lymph node, identification if Indicated.

II ). Gross Description. Received are specimen containers A to B. All requisitions and specimen containers are. labelled with the patient's na. cassettes and. are. labelled with the. A. Specimen is received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin. The container is. designated ""gallbladder"". The specimen consists of a collapsed gallbladder with abundant. fatty tissue around the gallbladder. The gallbladder measures 7.0 cm in length and up to. 2.5 cm in transverse diameter. On opening the gallbladder it contains a small amount of. mucoid bile as well as small fragments of calculus material ranging from 0.2 cm up to 0.8. cm. The mucosal surface is green and velvety. The gallbladder wall measures up to 0.2. cm in thickness. A cystic duct lymph node is visible at the proximal resection margin. The proximal resection margin and cystic duct lymph node are submitted in A1. Representative sections from the body and fundus are submitted in A2. B. Specimen is received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin. The container is. designated ""Whipple's specimen"". The specimen consists of a pancreatic duodenectomy. specimen. The duodenal portion measures 32.0 cm in length with a short segment of distal. antrum, 2.0 cm in length. The head of pancreas measures 6.0 cm from superior to. inferior, 3.5 cm from medial to lateral and approximately 3.5 cm in thickness from. anterior surface to retroperitoneal resection margin. The superior mesenteric vessel. groove is painted green and the protruding uncinate process is painted orange. The. retroperitoneal soft tissue margin is painted black. The resection margin at the neck. of. the pancreas is painted blue. The ampulla of Vater is somewhat protuberant, measuring. 1.5 cm across with mucosal congestion. The gallbladder is layed open to reveal a firm. tumorous mass encircling the common bile duct starting 0.8 cm from the opening of the. ampulla and extending out the common bile duct for a distance of 2.0 cm. The remaining. proximal common bile duct is 2.5 cm from the proximal extent of the mass. There is. a. bifurcation, likely representing a low insertion of the cystic duct. The bifurcation. lies 1.5 cm from the proximal common bile duct margin. An incision from the uncinate. process aspect at the head of pancreas shows a hard tumorous mass that occupies. approximately 50% of the head of pancreas measuring 3.0 cm from superior to inferior,. approximately 2.0 cm from the wall of the common bile duct in a medial-lateral. orientation and approximately 2.5 cm in thickness in AP orientation. The tumor appears. to lie closest to the retroperitoneal resection margin although soft friable fatty tissue. is present at the surface. The section of the soft tissue around the head of the. pancreas yields a distinct node at the proximal end of the common bile duct, two lymph. nodes along the superior edge of the head of pancreas, approximately four enlarged firm. areas, possibly nodes, in the adipose tissue attached to the distal stomach,. approximately four lymph nodes in the gastroduodenal zone and approximately three lymph. nodes in the fatty tissue at the inferior aspect at the head of pancreas. Sections are taken as follows: B1 - proximal common bile duct resection margin. B2 - resection margin at neck of pancreas. B3 - inferior edge at head of pancreas, perpendicular.

Collected Date: Received Date/TIme: D. The specimen consists of a pancreatoduodenectomy specimen, with the segment of distal antrum and duodenum. measuring 27.0 cm in length. There is a shallow indurated ulcerated area, 2.5 cm distal from the pyloric valve, measuring. 1.8 X 1.0 cm. This appears to lie 1.5 cm proximal to the area of the ampulla of Vater. This indurated ulcer appears to be in. continuity with an area tumorous induration in the attached head of pancreas. The head of pancreas measures 6.0 X 4.5 X. 3.0 cm. The uncinate margin and pancreatle neck margin are identified and painted orange and blue respectively. The. common bile duct can be Identified at the superior surface of the pancreas, and continuity cannot be traced through the. dense tumorous tissue in the head of pancreas. At the ampullary reglon, there is a nodular thickening lying beneath the. mucosa, measuring approximately 1.8 X 1,0 X 1.0 cm. Part of the common bile duct can be identified, but the exact orifice. is not clearly evident. Transverse sectioning of the head of pancreas reveals a firm craggy area beneath the area of. duodenal ulceration, this tumorous zone is ill-defined, but measures approximately 2.5 x 1.5 X 2.5 cm. It appears. to. extend. close to the uncinate margin and possibly extend into peripancreatic tissue in the upper pancreaticoduodenal area. The. ulcerated duodenal wall is obscured. Further sectioning reveals small firm lymph nodes in the vicinity of the common bile duct, the superior margin, and the. pancreas as well as in the pancreatoduodenal region. Sections are taken as follows: D1. Pancreatic neck margin. D2,D3. Two halves of the superior transverse section of pancreas. D4,D5. Two halves of next transverse section of pancreas. D6,D7. Two halves of transverse sections through mid zone of pancreas including uncinate. margin. D8. Additional sections of uncinate margin. D9,D10.

The tissue has a homogeneous. cut surface. The specimen is sectioned into three fragments and Is submitted entirely in two cassettes. Collected Date: Received Date/Time: Frozen Section Diagnosis. FSB. Bile Duct Margin: Negative for malignancy. FSC. Pancreatlc Margin: Negative for malignancy. Microscopic Description. A. The gallbladder shows chronic inflammation with mild irregularity of mucosal architecture. No cytologic atypia Is. present. B. Sections after routine processing confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Only a small segment of bile duct tissue is. present. The surface epithelium is partly denuded but residual epithellum shows no significant atypla and there is no. malignancy in this fragment. C. Sections after routine processing confirm the frozen section diagnosis. D. There is a widespread invasive pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma that shows a varied morphology, ranging from well-. defined angulated ductal structures through to areas where more solid sheets and small nodules and single cells with. prominent nuclear pleomorphism can be seen. The carcinoma erodes the common bile duct and focal areas on ductal. dyplasia are evident. Carcinoma is present in practically all of the sections taken. The extent of carcinoma thus exceeds. the extent of gross induration and It is estimated to have a size of at least 6,0 cm. Furthermore, carcinoma shows. extension beyond the pancreas Into peripancreatic tissue predominantly at the superior margin of the pancreas and in the. zone. between pancreas and duodenum. Carcinoma also invades into and through muscularis propria of the duodenum. and ulcerates the overlying duodenal mucosa, Carcinoma also focally involves the uncinate margin, and there are areas. where carcinoma encroaches on the cauterized soft tissue margin at the superior and posterior pancreaticoduodenal. area. There is prominent perineural invasion, and the section taken of the proximal common bile duct margin includes. carcinoma with perineural growth at this resection odge. There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in areas, and there is metastatic carcinoma in four of eleven lymph nodes. The proximal gastric and distal duodenal margins are unremarkable. The sections of the ampulla of Vater show. prominence of periductal glands and smooth muscle but no cytologic atypia or tumor. ACB: Collected Date: Received Date/Time: E.

The serosal surface is puckered. but there is no evidence of macroscpic invasion through the liver. capsule. The cut surface of the tumour is cream with a green tinge. and appears to have a fibrous capsule. The capsule is puckered but. there is no evidence of macroscopic invasion through the liver. capsule. Throughout the rest of the liver there are multiple. distended vessels within portal tracts that appear to be filled. with cream-coloured tissue similar to that of the tumour. The. tumour lies 12mm away from the resection margin which is inked. blue. The background liver does not appear obviously cirrhotic. Within the background liver a single other cream coloured nodule. is noted that does not seem to be associated with a portal area. that measures 4mm in maximum dimension.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is largely replaced by a hepatocellular. neoplasm with a heterogenous appearance, grossly and histologically. The. liver tumor is multinodular with areas of extensive hemorrhage and necrosis. The malignant hepatocytes are arranged in thickened cords with nuclear. atypia and mitosis with some areas of classical trabecular HCC. Areas of. extensive pseudoglandular architecture are also present as are areas of. diffuse intracytoplasmic vacuolar inclusions, resulting in a signet ring cell like. morphology. There are also extensive steatotic neoplastic hepatocytes with. cytoplasmic bile inclusions as well as some malignant cells with Mallory. hyaline. In some of the slightly more peripheral nodules, benign hepatocytes. have areas of FNH like architecture with proliferating ductules along fibrous. septa. In one of these foci, a nodule of definite HCC is present. Multifocal. venous invasion is seen (large and small) with at least one nodule of HCC. adhering to the endothelium. Areas of the nodules lack the cytologic and. architectural atypia to be considered HCC and appear to represent the. background adenoma. Immunohistochemical characterization is similarly heterogenous with areas of. steatotic hepatocytes within the nodule expressing amyloid A stain while other. areas with the FNH like architecture are negative for amyloid A. Glutamine. synthetase has a geographic staining pattern in apparently hepatocellular. adenoma like areas, with strong diffuse staining in steatotic and trabecular. HCC. Glypican 3 is negative throughout, while HSP 70 is positive in trabecular. HCC (focally in the same area as the glutamine synthetase). The non-neoplastic liver has intact architecture (supported by trichrome and. reticulin stains) with mild portal inflammation and patchy portal fibrosis. The. lobules have marked sinusoidal dilatation and congestion without other. significant inflammatory changes or steatosis. DPAS and Iron stains have no. significant positivity. Hepatitis B core and surface antigen stains are negative. INTERPRETATION: The findings are most consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma arising. in a hepatocellular adenoma. The non-neoplastic liver lacks features of chronic. hepatitis or cirrhosis. SYNOPTIC SUMMARY. Procedure: Partial hepatectomy. Major hepatectomy (3 segments or more). Specimen: Liver.

The patient is with a liver biopsy performed at an outside hospital which showed hepatocellular carcinomd. The patient now undergoes right hepatic lobectomy. GROSS DESCRIPTIONS. One appropriately labeled, formalin-filled, container is received. It contains a portion of right lobe of liver. weighing 321.2 grams and measuring 6.5 x 13.2 x 6.2 cm. cm. A small portion of tissue at the medial. side was sent for tissue procurement. The surgical margin is black. There is a 7.2 cm. (lateral to medial),. 3.6 cm. (anterior to posterior), and a 5.2 cm. (superior to inferior) firm, well demarcated mass at the. lateral side of the specimen. The mass is tan/white with focal bile staining. Grossly, the mass approaches. the the capsule on the anterior, posterior, and inferior surfaces, however the capsule appears intact. The. mass is 1.5 cm. away from the surgical margin. There is also a 0.7 cm. well demarcated small nodule. adjacent at the medial site which is separate from the main mass. The remaining liver parenchyma is. unremarkable. The attached gallbladder has been previously opened. The gallbladder appears. unremarkable. No stones are identified. BLOCK SUMMARY. 1 - lesion with lateral capsule. 2 lesion. 3 - lesion adjacent to the gallbladder. 4 - lesion adjacent to the gallbladder. 5 lesion. 6 lesion. 7 - surgical margin, adjacent to the gallbladder. 8-10 - additional section with surgical margin. 11 - smaller nodular lesion. 12 - normal appearing liver. 13 - surgical margin of cystic duct. 14 - representative section of gallbladder and additional. cystic duct section. LIGHT MICROSCOPY. Light microscopic examination is performed. Sections reveal that both of the grossly identified masses are moderately differentiated hepatocellular 1. carcinoma. The tumor cells have a cord-like distribution and display moderate nuclear atypia. The tumor. closely approaches the hepatic capsule, but does not invade through it. Apparent lymphovascular space. invasion is present within the liver in the area of the gallbladder bed. The surrounding, non-neoplastic. liver shows some bile stasis, which is predominantly intrahepatocellular. There is mild bile duct. proliferation and scattered neutrophilic aggregates within portal areas and sinusoids. These findings are. suggestive of a biliary obstruction, possibly secondary to the tumor. Also present are mild portal. lymphocytic infiltrates, consistent with a mild (Grade 1) chronic hepatitis. Viral cytopathic. effect is not noted. An iron stain shows no evidence of iron accumulation within the liver. There is no. evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis. Small foci of macrovesicular steatosis are noted. DIAGNOSIS. LIVER, RIGHT LOBE, LOBECTOMY - MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED HEPATOCELLULAR. CARCINOMA, TWO FOCI (7.2 AND 0.7 CM.

Microscopic Description. Sections show a well circumscribed moderately differentiated hepatocellular. carcinoma with pushing borders. The carcinoma has a trabecular pattern >4 cells thick. with notable areas of pseudoglandular architecture with pleomorphic hyperchromatic foci. The morphology suggests a mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma with stem cell. features. However, the immunoprofile failed to support this diagnosis. The tumor is diffusely and strongly positive for glypican-3 indicating. hepatocellular origin. It shows patchy moderate positivity alpha-1 antitrypsin, very. focal mild HepParl. Other markers of hepatocellular differentiation (alpha fetoprotein,. polyclonal CEA, cytoplasmic TTF-1, BHCG and OCT3/4 are largely negative. Markers of cholangiocytic differentiation (CK7, CK19 and polyclonal CEA). There. is however, patchy strong staining for EMA. Stem cell features are only supported by focal positivity for CD56 while CD19 and. C-KIT are negative. This does not support the presence of any stem cell component. CD30 is negative.

Clinical correlation in. suggeoted. Overall, the histopathological changes of background liver are most consistent. with aus active steatohepatitis, although other causes of liver injury should. be clinically and serologically excluded. gteatohepatitis is a non-specific. pattern of injury seen most commonly with morbid obesity, diabetes, insulin. resistance, and alcohol abuse. However, it can also be associated with. nutritional causes, wuch as protain-calorie malnutrition, starvation, rapid. weight loss, and various intestinal bypase or gastric stapling surgeries. Hepatic ateat0818 and steatnhepatitia can also be the result of medications,. including amiodarone, perhexiline maleate, glucoourticoids, uynthetic. estrogens, calcium channel blockers, tamoxifen, methotrexate, valpreic acid,. cocaine, and anti-viral agente (Zidovudina, Didanosine, and rialuridine). Netabolic disorders can aloo cause steatosis and steatChepatitis: hyperlipidemia, Wilson's disease, adult onnetcitrullinemia (type II),. lipodystrophy, dyabecalipoprotainemie, weber-Christian-Disense, Wolman's.

ADDENDA: Addendum. Molecular Anatomic Pathology Testing: Block 3A, microdisgection target 1 (T1) : A. Losa of heterozygosity is IDENTIFIED at chromosome 5q (378). B. Fractional Allelic Loss is 8% (1 locus with losa/12 informative loci). Block 4B, microdissection target 2 (T2). A. Loss of heterozygosity is IDENTIFIED at chromosome 1p (32%). B. Fractional Allelic Loss is 81 (1 locus with loss/12 informative loci). Note: LOH of high amplitude is considered when more than 75% of cellular DNA is. affected. Loss of heterozygosity of tumor suppressor gene alleles is known to occur in. liver neoplasias and to correlate with tumor progression. As reported in the. literature, benign neoplasme (hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia). typically have low frequency of LOH (mean fractional allelic loss ~6$) and. hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) frequently have higher prevalence of LOH (mean. fractional allele loss -30%) (1,2) Some studies have shown that HCC with. FAL of <30 are associated with indolent biological behavior and FAL of >30%. with an aggressive biological behavior (3-5) LOK mutations are reported as. high amplitude when more than 75% of cellular DNA ie affected. Some HCC with. low amplitude LOH mutations and FAL 25-35 t considered to be indeterminate. biological behavior. However, not all cumors reveal auch a correlation and,. therefore, the LOH profile should be interpreted in the context of the. cytologic and histologic findings and the patient s clinical history. Sample Preparation and LOH Analysis. Manual microdicsection of the tissue sample was performed to include tumor. tissue and normal adjacent tissue (if available) or a blood sampla. DNA was. isclated using standard laboratory procedure. Specimeno with the minimium of. 50% of tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Eighteen microsatellite markers (listed below) that have been previously found. to be involved in liver neoplasia and/or co-localize with known tumor. suppressor genes were used for analysis. PCR was performed using. fluorescently labeled primers and the products of amplification were detected. using capillary electrophoresis on ABI3730 platform. Relative fluorescence was. determined for individual alleles and the ratio of peaks was calculated. Normal tissue was examined to determine whether the. patient 19 neterozygous at the marker (genetically informative) and neoplastic. tissue was then analyzed to detect loss of heterozygosity. Thresholds for. significant allelic imbalance were determined using normal (non-neoplastic). specimens for every marker. Loss of heterozygosity was determined using (NL /. NS). (TL/TS) formula and reported when allelic ratio for a particular marker. was below 0.5 or above 2.0. When normal tissue was not available, peak height. ratios falling outside of 2 SDs beyond the mean for each polymorphic allele. paring were assessed as showing loss of heterozygosity. D19407. 1p36.

The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled ""partial liver. resection, sections 5 and 6 - frozen for margin. "" It consists of a 520. gram, 14 x 9.8 x 7.5 cm partial liver resection. The smooth capsular. surface displays an 11.5 x 8 x 7 cm bosselated tan tumor bulging from its. external surface. The margin is inked blue and the tissue is serially cross. sectioned. INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION: ""Tumor grossly 1 cm from cauterized. margin"" is rendered by. The tumor has variegated, lobulated, yellow, tan, pink and brown cut. surfaces with predominantly well-defined edges. The tumor grossly abuts the. gallbladder bed. Extension through the capsule and into the gallbladder bed. is not seen. No other lesions are seen on the red-brown hepatic parenchyma. The attached 8.7 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter intact distended. gallbladder has smooth glistening serosal surfaces which are mildly. edematous. Received within the gallbladder lumen are numerous 0. cm in. average diameter dark green, black multifaceted choleliths aggregating to. 6.5 x 4.5 x 0.7 cm. On opening the mucosa displays two components. One. component extending to the cystic duct margin for a length of 2 cm. is. red-tan and velvety. The remaining component of the mucosa is pink-tan. flat to velvety with a slightly thickened wall up to 0.2-0.3 cm thick and. measuring approximately 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The remaining mucosa. at the body and fundus is tan with thin trabeculations. Representative sections are submitted in eight cassettes labeled: 1-2. Liver tumor with closest blue -inked margin. 3-4.

Received are specimen containers A in . requisitions and specimen containers are. labelled with the patient's name,. The cassettes and identifiers are. labelled with the Surgical Number. A. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated. as ""A - liver segment 6"". The specimen consists of a 131.8 gram, 10.0 x 5.6 x 5.9 cm. portion of liver. The capsular surface is smooth and predominantly tan with a focal. hemorrhagic area. The resection margin is painted blue. Sectioning reveals a 5.0 x 4.5. x 4.5 cm well demarcated multinodular mass which replaces most of the resected liver. The nodules are variably yellow green to tan with foci of hemorrhage and necrosis. The. mass comes to within 1.0 cm to the parenchymal resection margin. The remaining liver. parenchyma is brown, tan, slightly firm, and nodular. Sections are submitted as follows: A1-4. mass in relation to parenchymal resection margin with A1 demonstrating area. of necrosis. A5-7. lesion in relation to the capsule, A5-6 demonstrating areas of hemorrhage. A8-10. representative sections from remaining liver parenchyma. B. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated. as ""B - right diaphragm and tumor"" The specimen consists of a 4.5 x 3.3 x 0.9 cm. irregular portion of grey-tan to dark brown tissue. One surface is grey-tan and smooth. The opposite surface is dark brown and roughened. Sectioning reveals a central area that. is light brown and homogeneous. Six representative sections are submitted in B1-B3. The. remaining specimen is submitted in toto following initial histologic examination in B4-. B6. C. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated. as ""C - right adrenal. The specimen consists of multiple portions of fibrofatty tissue. measuring in aggregate 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. The cut surface shows predominantly yellow. adipose tissue with areas of semi firm tan to hemorrhagic friable tissue. A definitive. adrenal gland is not identified. Sections are submitted as follows: C1. slightly firm tan to hemorrhagic tissue submitted in toto. C2-3. remainder of tissue submitted in toto. Pathologist Comment. The hepatocellular carcinoma shows a classical trabecular / sinusoidal growth pattern. with a few foci of acinar growth. The tumor is morphologically heterogeneous, ranging. from moderately differentiated to poorly differentiated with anaplastic cytology. While. the main tumor mass is excised with a 7 mm margin, there is extensive lymphovascular. invasion beyond the tumor capsule, and intralymphatic tumor is present within 2.4 mm of. the parenchymal resection margin. Cauterized fragments of tumor are present in blood. clot adherent to the diaphragm, but these may represent intraoperative artifact, and no. true invasion of the diaphragm is identified. Finally, the specimen designated ""adrenal"". shows adipose tissue with a large intravenous tumor embolus. No adrenal gland is. identified. Per discussion with Dr. this tissue was taken from the fat plane. between the liver and the adrenal, and therefore this may represent local extension of. tumor. Finally, the background liver shows cirrhosis (consistent with the known history of. hepatitis B) as well as a single well-formed non-necrotizing granuloma. Special stains. for infectious organisms are pending, and will be reported as an addendum. In case ancillary studies are desired, tumor block information is 'listed below: Best tumor block: A6.
